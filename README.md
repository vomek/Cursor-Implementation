# Cursor-Implementation

<h1>Special Data Type Cursor</h1>
 <p> Linked Lists and Arrays are used to store data. Both  have  their  advantages  and disadvantages.  For  example,  we  know  that  insertion  and  deletion  takes  O(n)  time  in  arrays because we have to move all the elements towards right or towards left respectively. Insertion and  deletion  takes  O(1)  time  in  Linked  List but we repeatedly have to use “new” and “delete” commands  which  are  very  slow  operations. Hence,  people  use  a  special  data  type  called “Cursor” which is a mixture of both Linked List and arrays.</p>
